  <h1 id="top">Translating <em>A Visual Git Reference</em></h1>

  <p>Thanks to kindness of others, <a href='index-en.html'><em>A Visual Git
      Reference</em></a> has been translated from English into several other
  languages.  If you would like to translate it into your native language, I
  would be happy to receive your patch!  Please follow the below guide to get
  you started.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Fork <a href='https://github.com/MarkLodato/visual-git-guide'>MarkLodato/visual-git-guide</a>
    on Github.</li>
    <li>Clone your fork.</li>
    <li>Translate the work, following the same scheme as the other languages.
    Be sure to remember to add your name to the copyright notice in README.md
    and index-en.html.  There are more steps, but if you don't follow them,
    don't worry&mdash;I'll take care of the rest.</li>
    <li>Commit and push your changes back to Github repository.</li>
    <li>Submit a pull request via the Github website.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>The nitty-gritty</h3>

  <p>I'll take care of these details if you don't want to worry about them,
  but here they are in case you are interested:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Add your name to the bottom of the copyright notice in README.md and
    index-en.html.</li>
    <li>Add a link from index.html to index-<em>LANG</em>.html, where
    <li>Add index-<em>LANG</em>.html to the <tt>HTML</tt> Makefile
    variable.</li>
    <li>Copy index-en.html to index-<em>LANG</em>.html.
    <li>Translate the new file.  Remember to update the <tt>html lang</tt>
    tag on line 2, remove the copyright notices for all the other languages,
    and (if possible) link to the appropriate language Creative Commons
    translation.</li>
    <li>Add a link to your page on index-*.html.  Again, please keep this
    sorted by filename.  Remember to create links on the other languages and
    create a non-link for your language on your own page.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Images</h3>

  <p>Unfortunately, the current setup makes it difficult to translate the
  images.  If there is sufficient interest, I can rearrange things so that
  each language could have its own images.  For now, they're all in English!
